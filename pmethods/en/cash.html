<h2>Buy Bitcoins at Peer-to-Peer Exchanges</h2>

<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin exchanges are a great way to get bitcoins with cash. A P2P trade usually works something like this:</p>
<img class="img-responsive kb-helper" alt="localbitcoins" src="/img/instantly/lb.png">
<p><ol>
<li>A buyer and seller use a site like <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins">LocalBitcoins</a> or <a href="/exchanges/wall-of-coins/">Wall of Coins</a> and agree on a price.</li>
<li>The seller’s bitcoins are held by the site (in this case <a href="/exchanges/localbitcoins/">LocalBitcoins</a> or <a href="/exchanges/wall-of-coins/">Wall of Coins</a>) and only released to the buyer upon confirmation of payment.</li>
<li>The buyer deposits cash into the seller’s bank account.</li>
<li>The seller confirms payment.</li>
<li>The site (LocalBitcoins or Wall of Coins) releases the bitcoins to the buyer.</li>
<li>The seller got cash, and the buyer got bitcoins. The trade is complete!</li>
</ol></p>
<p>The above was just an example. Through sites like LocalBitcoins you can agree on other payment methods besides cash deposit. For example, you could arrange to meet in person and exchange cash for Bitcoin.</p>
<p> There are two main reasons that P2P exchanges offer a near instant way to buy bitcoins: </p>
<img class="img-responsive halfimg-right" alt="cash" src="/img/icons/sepa.png">
<ol>
<li>No verification is required. You don’t need to submit any personal details and there is no verification process that takes up time. </li>
<li>Cash payments are irreversible. Once cash is in someone’s bank account, the buyer of bitcoin has no way to reverse the transaction. So the seller can feel confident that he received payment for bitcoins, and release the bitcoins to the buyer. </li>
</ol>

<p>P2P exchanges offer a fast way to buy bitcoins, but P2P exchange rates may be a bit higher than the global average Bitcoin exchange rate. People are willing to pay more to buy bitcoins both more privately and faster. The markup is usually somewhere around 5-10% on <a href="http://buybitcoinww.co/local_bitcoins">LocalBitcoins</a>. <a href="/exchanges/wall-of-coins/">Wall of Coins</a> generally has rates close to market. Check the against a Bitcoin price index like <a href="https://bitcoinaverage.com/">Bitcoin Average</a> or the <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/price/">CoinDesk BPI</a>.</p>
